Sim Studio is a powerful platform for building, testing, and optimizing agentic workflows. It provides developers with intuitive tools to design sophisticated agent-based applications through a visual interface. Whether you're prototyping a simple AI assistant or building complex multi-agent systems, Sim Studio offers the flexibility and performance needed for modern AI applications.

## Why Sim Studio?

Building agentic applications has traditionally required extensive coding and integration work. Developers often find themselves spending more time on infrastructure and plumbing rather than focusing on the core AI logic. Sim Studio changes this by providing a comprehensive visual workflow editor that handles the complexity while keeping you in control of what matters.

## Features

Sim Studio provides a wide range of features designed to accelerate your development process:
