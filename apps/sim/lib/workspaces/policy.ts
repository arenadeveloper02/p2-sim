 * not to belong to the organization never serializes against its admins.
 *
 * It is also taken after the organization's own revalidation — the `FOR UPDATE`
 * subscription re-read and the owner lookup — so an org-wide key that every
 * permission-group admin write contends on is not held across a blocking row
 * lock that can wait out the full `lock_timeout`. Only the capability read and
