 * Projects a chat deployment onto the internal editor's detail shape.

 * schemaless JSON columns, so their defaults are applied here rather than
 * assumed: a row written before a field existed reads as its empty value
 * instead of `null` reaching the client.
 *
 * Golden queries live in `workflow_queries`, not `chat.customizations`. Pass
 * the table strings so the deploy modal sees the same list as the live chat.
